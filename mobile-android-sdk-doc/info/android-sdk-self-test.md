Testing and troubleshooting
===========================

After you have integrated the Prebid Rendering Mobile Android SDK, you should test
your implementation.

> **Important:** For troubleshooting and diagnostic purposes, please [install an HTTP
debugging proxy](#using-charles-web-proxy) such as Charles Web Proxy. You may need to
provide logs to Prebid.

General testing requirements
----------------------------------------

Please make sure that you:

-   Have a good communications connection on the device, such as
    reliable wireless network signal. If you can\'t reproduce the
    problem, it could be a communications issue.
-   Have a valid user agent if you are expecting live ads. Testing with a real device that does not have ad
    tracking limited will help buyers bid on the inventory.
-   Have embedded the SDK in your app as instructed in [Importing the
    Android SDK](../info/android-sdk-integration.md).
-   Have updated the manifest as instructed in [Integrating the SDK with
    your project](../info/android-sdk-integration.md).
-   Have set the appropriate [listener
    methods](../info/android-in-app-bidding-listeners.md):
    -   `onAdLoaded` (highly recommended)
    -   `onAdFailed` (highly recommended)
    -   Other listener methods as needed
-   Have turned on the SDKÂ logging by setting the
    [PrebidRenderingSettings](../info/android-sdk-parameters.md#prebidrenderingsettings) `logLevel`
    parameter to `DEBUG` on app `init`.
    > **Tip:** You may want to copy and save your on-screen log messages in case you need to include them in your resolution assistance request
-   Are using the latest version of the SDK (to check for the latest
    version, see [Release notes](../info/android-in-app-bidding-release-notes.md)).
-   Are [using Charles](../info/android-sdk-self-test.md#using-charles-web-proxy) to verify network requests are
    passing correctly.

    >**Important:** If you encounter issues, see a list of [possible problems and
solutions](../info/android-sdk-self-test.md#troubleshooting) below. If you still can\'t resolve your issues,
please request resolution assistance through the [Prebid Support
Community](https://docs.prebid.org/support/index.html) and make sure to include your
Charles logs and any SDK error message.

Using Charles Web Proxy
------------------------------------

An HTTP debugging proxy, such as Charles Web Proxy, allows you to
observe network traffic coming from Android simulators and devices and
diagnose issues with your Prebid Rendering Mobile Android SDK implementation. You
can download and install Charles from <https://www.charlesproxy.com/>.

Use Charles to verify network requests are passing correctly. For
example, to verify that you are sending a valid ad request, copy the ad
request URL from Charles and paste it in your browser and see if you are
getting a valid response.

> **Tip:** Consider using a filter such as \"prebid\" to avoid sifting through a lot
of unrelated traffic.

Ad exception types and examples
--------------------------------------

Exceptions can inform you of configuration issues or possible issues
that need to be resolved by Prebid. The following table summarizes the
types of exceptions that may occur and provides examples of common log
messages.

| Error type      | Message example                                              | Reason                                                       | What to do                                                   |

| INVALID_REQUEST | "Invalid request: No domain was specified"<br />"Invalid request: No ad unit ID was specified" | There could be a problem with your configuration.            | Check your configuration. Invalid request errors usually inform you of a missing required setting, such as no ad unit ID specified, no creative specified, or no domain specified. If you need help with troubleshooting configuration errors, please visit the [Prebid Support Community](https://docs.prebid.org/support/index.html). |
| INIT_ERROR      | "Internet permission not granted"<br />"Failed to fetch advertisement ID" | There is a problem with permissions or initialization of system services in the SDK. | Check your AndroidManifest.xml and make sure you have followed the instructions in [Integrating the SDK with your project](../info/android-sdk-integration.md). |
| INTERNAL_ERROR  | "SDK internal error: Invalid ad response: Invalid VAST Response: less than 100 characters." | There could be a problem with your SDK implementation or with Prebid. For example, the video ad unit may not be returning the right VAST response. | Please request resolution assistance through the [Prebid Support Community](https://docs.prebid.org/support/index.html) and make sure to include the error message. |
| SERVER_ERROR    | "Bad server response - **"HTTP Response code of %s"**           | Indicates a problem that needs to be resolved by Prebid.      | Please complete follow the [testing guidelines](../info/android-sdk-self-test.md#general-testing-requirements) above. If you cannot resolve the issue, please request resolution assistance through the [Prebid Support Community](https://docs.prebid.org/support/index.html) and make sure to include the error message. |

Below are examples of an `onAdFailed` and error messages that
appear when you use incorrect delivery domain or ad unit ID.

-   If the *delivery domain is incorrect*:

    ```
    SDK internal error: Invalid ad response: (server status code)
    ```

-   If the *delivery domain is correct*, but the *ad unit is incorrect*:

    ```
